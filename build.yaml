#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]

#   - board: bdn9_rev2

# Reset Split Keyboard Procedure
# Perform the following steps to reset both halves of your split keyboard:
# - Put each half of the split keyboard into bootloader mode.
# - Flash one of the halves of the split with the downloaded settings reset UF2
# image. Immediately after flashing the chosen half, put it into bootloader
# mode to avoid accidental bonding between the halves.
# - Repeat step 2 with the other half of the split keyboard.
# - Flash the actual image for each half of the split keyboard (e.g
# my_board_left.uf2 to the left half, my_board_right.uf2 to the right half).
#
# After completing these steps, pair the halves of the split keyboard
# together by resetting them at the same time. Most commonly, this is done by
# grounding the reset pins for each of your keyboard's microcontrollers or
# pressing the reset buttons at the same time.
